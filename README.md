# Network Based Text-Editor

An academic project which was done in 2012 when as an academic project in my 2nd year. I ([Hasib Billah](https://github.com/halfo/) ) and one of my classmates ([Sadman Ilham](https://github.com/Sadman-Ilham/) ) collaborated our idea to make this happen.

**Features**
- Syntax Highlighting (for (C++* and *Java*)
- Code Completion
- Code Folding
- Bracket Matching
- Build & Run option (for (C++* and *Java*)

*Dependency: [RSyntaxTextArea](http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea/)*

 This is our first java project. We admit that this code is not clean as we were not very experts with OOP concept.
