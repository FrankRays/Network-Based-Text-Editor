An academic project which was done in 2012 when I was in 2nd year 1st semester. This is a text editor that has the capability of runtime text sharing. Through this user can also chat with other users. Two compilers are attached to this editor for executing c++ and java. The text sharing part was done with socket programming. Me and one of my classmates collaborated our idea to make this. This is our first java project. I admit that this code is not clean as we were not very experts with oop concept. N.B: Before running that project add 'RSyntaxTextArea' as an external library.
