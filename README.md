# Network Based Text-Editor

An academic project which was done in 2012. I ([Sadman Ilham](https://github.com/Sadman-Ilham/)) and one of my classmates ([Hasib Billah](https://github.com/halfo/)) collaborated our ideas to make this happen.


**Features**
- Syntax Highlighting (for *C++* and *Java*)
- Code Completion
- Code Folding
- Bracket Matching
- Split View
- Build & Run option (for *C++* and *Java*)
- Runtime **code sharing**
- *Chat with other users*


*Dependency: [RSyntaxTextArea](http://fifesoft.com/rsyntaxtextarea/)*


 This is our first java project. We admit that this code is not clean as we were not very experts with OOP concept.
